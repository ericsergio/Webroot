            My name is Eric Sergio, I am a BAS Application Development student at Bellevue College. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I am the lead bartender at Outback Steakhouse in Bothell and have been with the company 
            for over 10 years. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Shortly after my daughter was born, I made the decision to return to school which has 
            proven to be a rewarding experience. I recently received my Associates of Technical Arts 
            Degree in Web Application and Cloud Development from Edmonds College. I am now at Bellevue 
            College, enrolled in the Application Development Bachelor of Applied Science Degree and am 
            slated to graduate in Spring of 2023. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from the responsibilities that come with being a dad, a student, and with work I tend 
            to spend most of my “off-time” either playing with my daughter or practicing whatever 
            technology I am currently working with. I also enjoy doing DIY projects around my house; 
            anything from learning how to tile to carpentry, I usually have multiple projects in progress. 
          </p>
